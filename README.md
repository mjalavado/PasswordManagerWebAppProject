# User Stories

2. As someone who works in the IT security team of the University On-Campus IT team, I need to use a password manager web application so that I can securely store the IT team’s sensitive credentials.
3. As someone who works on multiple devices and rarely stays on one device, I want to use a password manager web application so that I can just use a browser on any device to access my passwords stored in my account.
4. As a worker who works for a company that demands frequent password changes, I need to use a password manager web application that allows me to update passwords so that I can comply with my company’s standards of strong updated passwords.
5. As someone who has many accounts for different websites, I need to use a password manager web application with a lot of storage space so that I don’t need to write all my account credentials on a piece of paper and potentially lose it.
