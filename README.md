# Overview
The password manager web application is an application with the main purpose of securely storing the user's sensitive credentials.

# Project Description
The password manager web application is an app that will store a registered user’s login credentials for various websites that they frequently visit and use. Its main purpose is to securely store a list of credentials for the user instead of using physical space to store passwords like writing down their passwords on a notepad or piece of paper. All the user needs to do to see their list of passwords is to register an account into the web app and log in to their account, and if they have additional passwords that they have, they will be able to add I into their list using their account for the web app.

# User Stories
1. As an office worker for a company that needs to log in to many sites for my job, I need to use a password manager web application so that I don’t have to remember each password for the accounts on various sites.
2. As someone who works in the IT security team of the University On-Campus IT team, I need to use a password manager web application so that I can securely store the IT team’s sensitive credentials.
3. As someone who works on multiple devices and rarely stays on one device, I want to use a password manager web application so that I can just use a browser on any device to access my passwords stored in my account.
4. As a worker who works for a company that demands frequent password changes, I need to use a password manager web application that allows me to update passwords so that I can comply with my company’s standards of strong updated passwords.
5. As someone who has many accounts for different websites, I need to use a password manager web application with a lot of storage space so that I don’t need to write all my account credentials on a piece of paper and potentially lose it.
