# Prototype

This is the prototype of my password manager web application. The prototype contains mockups of the application's HTML pages. Currently, the application has mockups of 6 web pages. 

## Application Overview

The password manager web application is an app that allows the user to safely store a list of passwords that they frequently use for various accounts. The user will be able to add, update, and/or delete passwords in their account.

## Welcome Page

This page is the "Welcome" page of the web application. The page will be the first thing the user sees when entering the site. It will display a welcome message and basic information about the site, its purpose, and its functionalities. In addition, there will be 2 buttons which are the "Register" and "Log In" buttons. The "Register" button will redirect the user to the "Register" page, and the "Log In" button will redirect the user to the "Sign In" page.

## Register Page

This page is the "Register" page of the web application. The user can access this page by clicking the register button on the "Welcome" page or by clicking the hyperlink on the "Log In" page. To register an account, a user must enter the necessary credentials into the text boxes. The "Master PIN" text box is used for the PIN code that allows the user to decrypt and reveal the password to the user. The "Back" button returns the user to the "Welcome" page.

## Log In Page

This page is the "Log In" page of the web application. Only registered users can sign in to the web app. If the user is not registered and tries to sign in, they will receive a hyperlink that will redirect them to the "Register" page if they click the link. The "Back" button returns the user to the "Welcome" page. Once the user successfully logs in, they will be redirected to their "Main" Page.

## Main Page

This is the "Main" page of the web application. The "Main" page is what the user will see once they have logged into the web app. It displays the list of their passwords, along with the name of the site and the usernames for those accounts. There are also 4 buttons on the "Main" page: the "Add Password" button, the "View/Edit" button, the "Delete" button, and the "Log Out" Button. The "Add Password" will redirect the user to the "Add Password" page, where they can add a password to their list. The "View/Edit" button redirects the user to the "Account Information" page where they can see their credentials for a specific account. The "Delete" button will delete an account from the list. A prompt will display to the user asking if they are sure they want to delete the password or not. If the user clicks "Yes" then the password is deleted from the list, and if they click "No" the prompt will be closed. The "Log Out" button logs the user out of their account and returns them to the "Welcome" Page.

## Account Information Page

This is the "Account Information" page of the web application. Here it shows the user's credentials for an account in their list. The "Edit" button will allow the user to edit the information of that specific account. The "View Password" button will decrypt the password and reveal it to the user. If the user clicks the "Edit" or the "View Password" button, a prompt will be shown to the user asking them for their Master PIN code. If the code is provided and is correct, the user may be able to edit and view their password.
